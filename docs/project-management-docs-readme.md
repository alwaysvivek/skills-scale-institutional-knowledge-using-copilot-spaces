# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

OctoAcme's project management framework centers on clear ownership, iterative delivery, and data-informed decision-making. From project initiation through to release and continuous improvement, every effort is designed to maximize customer value while promoting transparency and psychological safety. Each project is guided through a high-level lifecycle of initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. The initiation phase involves validating the problem, aligning stakeholders, and establishing measurable goals and a clear timeline. Planning then transforms these goals into actionable backlogs, documents dependencies and risks, and defines success criteria and milestones.

The OctoAcme team structure is anchored by well-defined personas and roles. Project Managers coordinate timelines, risks, and communications, ensuring smooth delivery and documentation. Product Managers own the vision, prioritize backlogs, and focus on outcome measurement. Developers are responsible for implementation, design, and testing, while QA/Testing ensures that acceptance criteria and quality standards are met. Stakeholders give input and approvals at key decision points. Each role maintains specific responsibilities and communication routines—ranging from daily standups and weekly syncs to monthly status updates—ensuring that all parties remain informed and aligned.

Key workflows leverage tools such as project and backlog boards, established pull request conventions, and rigorous acceptance criteria for all deliverables. The planning and execution phases use prioritized backlogs, sprint planning, and regular demonstrations to drive progress and surface risks early. Risk management is iterative and visible, employing a structured risk register that records ownership, impact, and mitigation strategies, reviewed frequently in team syncs. The communication strategy is layered, with weekly delivery and management syncs, scheduled demos, and clearly defined escalation paths to resolve blockers and critical issues swiftly.

Quality assurance is integral at every stage. Automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end), CI/CD practices, scheduled demos, and manual QA checks ensure that releases meet rigorous standards before deployment. Releases follow standardized checklists—incorporating stakeholder communications, release notes, and rollback plans—minimizing risk and supporting operational visibility. Continuous improvement is facilitated through retrospectives, action tracking, and a culture of feedback, with the aim of progressively refining both process and product outcomes over time.
